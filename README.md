# SoundCloud-Playlist-Downloader
A python program that uses Selenium to take URL's of the users songs in their SoundCloud playlist and downloads them.

I have included chromedriver (for MacOS) which must be unzipped and it's location must be specified in the program.


# System requirements:  
   python3
   Selenium
   Chromedriver
   Chrome


To do this: 
    driver = webdriver.Chrome("Your specified location")
    
# Usage:
    Enter your SoundCloud playlist URL to the python program.

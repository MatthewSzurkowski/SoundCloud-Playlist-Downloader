# SoundCloud-Playlist-Downloader
A python program that uses selenium to take URL's of the users songs in their SoundCloud playlist and downloads them.

I have included chromedriver which must be unzipped and it's location must be specified in the program.

To do this: 
  
    driver = webdriver.Chrome("Your specified location")
    
Usage:
    
    Enter your SoundCloud playlist URL to the python program.
